#How to use

Simply open the file index.html.

#Explanation

Since the page is pretty much static, as the document said, and it is a Landing Page, i assumed that the best is to go into a native html and js page, the reason is because of the SEO, native pages are the best on SEO because there is no "weird" generated html code by frameworks, and you can follow everything that is better for SEO perfectly, and too, a native page will of course be the faster page ever. On the end of it, you will have a great and fast landing page, and google search engine will of course like it soo much.

Ps: another reason to the native page is just because i am trying to show my native js/css/html knowledge skills that is the base of every programmer.
